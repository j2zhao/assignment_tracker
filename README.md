# assignment_tracker


**Relevent folder**:
- jupyter_tracker


**Deployment Method**:
- Move custom.js file to ~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js
- Move jupyter_record.py to enclosing folder with Jupyter Notebook files or add to PATH (note: I didn't test adding to path)
- Create a new Jupyter Notebook. Make sure that you have the appropriate name for that notebook before starting work. You might have to delete generated cells with previous names, if you open the notebook before renaming. The notebook name determines the logging file that is written to.
- Everything should be written to the ''code_history'' folder in the same directory as ''jupyter_record.py''.
