The goal of this our project is to track the process of how expert data scientists actually reason with data in a machine learning project. \n",

We also ask you not to use machine learning code generation tools such as ChatGPT, Github Copilate, and Google Bard. Note that copy and paste have been disabled on this notebook as a barrier for these tools.\n",
